# ELMAH

The ELMAH code repo is in migration. Being a project with a long history,
its source is spread across several repositories:

* [Subversion][svnrepo]: Oldest code repo before migration to Mercurial
* [Mercurial][hgrepos]: Current & [on BitBucket][hgrepos] since 
  [Google Code shutdown][gcshutdown]
* [Git][gitrepos]: Coming soon though some newer projects that build on top
  of the [latest 1.2.2 release][release] are already here

Subscribe to [issue #400][#400] to be notified on the migration progress.

The [issues][issues] have already been migrated and you are welcome to
subscribe and participate.
